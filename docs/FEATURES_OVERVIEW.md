## Emergency Response System

> **Internet Status:** ✅ Works Completely Offline - No internet required

### Comprehensive SOS Management

The emergency response system is designed for real-world incident coordination and works entirely on your local mesh network:

**Alert Types:**
- `SOS` - General emergency
- `SOSP` - Police emergency
- `SOSF` - Fire emergency
- `SOSM` - Medical emergency

**Features:**
- **Automatic Logging**: Every alert logged with timestamp, location, and details

- **Multiple Incidents**: Handle several emergencies simultaneously
- **Escalation System**: Automatic escalation for unacknowledged alerts
- **Check-in System**: Periodic check-ins with SOS users
- **Resolution Tracking**: Complete audit trail from alert to resolution

### Incident Workflow

1. **Alert Detection**: User sends SOS message
2. **Automatic Logging**: System creates incident record
3. **Responder Notification**: Designated responders are alerted
4. **Coordination**: Responders acknowledge and coordinate
5. **Check-ins**: System checks in with SOS user periodically
6. **Resolution**: Incident marked resolved with notes

### Emergency Commands

```
SOS [message]           # Trigger general emergency alert
SOSP [message]          # Police emergency
SOSF [message]          # Fire emergency
SOSM [message]          # Medical emergency
ACK [incident#]         # Acknowledge alert (responders)
RESPONDING [incident#]  # Indicate you're responding
CLEAR                   # Clear your active alert
SAFE                    # Indicate you're safe
